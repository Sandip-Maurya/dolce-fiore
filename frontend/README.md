## About

**Dolce Fiore** is a premium e-commerce platform for handcrafted gift hampers that celebrate health, sustainability, and conscious living. Every product is designed to delight while leaving a positive impact on people and the planet.

### Brand Story

Dolce Fiore began as a homegrown venture with a simple dream — to craft thoughtful, sustainable gifting experiences. What started four years ago with a passion for healthy indulgence has grown into a celebration of creativity and conscious living.

Our hampers feature:
- **Organic, guilt-free treats** — Premium ingredients without compromise
- **Air-fried savories** — Healthier alternatives to traditional snacks
- **Sugar-free chocolates** — Indulgence without the guilt
- **Eco-friendly, reusable packaging** — Sustainable materials that become part of the gift

We proudly partner with local artisans across India, bringing tradition and sustainability into every creation.

## Current Status

- The committed source code is missing the entire `src/lib` directory (API client, endpoint definitions, hooks, and environment config) that all pages import. Until those modules are restored, the frontend will not compile (`npm run dev`/`npm run build` will fail) even though the rest of the UI components and pages are present.

### Design Philosophy

- **Premium • Minimal • Elegant • Conscious • Artisanal**
- Soft neutral palette (warm beige, off-white, deep brown/charcoal, muted gold)
- Sustainable textures (kraft paper, wood, marble, cotton, jute)
- Premium photography with natural light and editorial vibe
- Smooth, subtle animations

### Target Audience

Premium, health-conscious, eco-aware customers and luxury gift buyers who value quality, sustainability, and thoughtful gifting.

> Note: The codebase references a `src/lib` folder (API client/endpoints/hooks), but those files are not present in the repository. Restore them to satisfy imports before running or building the app.

### Architecture Principles

- **Feature-Based Organization** — Code is organized by features (products, cart, orders) rather than by file type
- **Separation of Concerns** — Clear separation between UI components, business logic, and data fetching
- **Reusable Components** — Shared components in `components/` directory
- **API Abstraction** — Intended centralized client and endpoint files in `src/lib` (currently missing from the repo)
- **Type Safety** — Full TypeScript coverage with strict typing
- **Mock-First Development** — MSW enables frontend development without backend dependency

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** — Version 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn** — Package manager
- **Git** — Version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dolce-fiore/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal)
   - The app will automatically reload when you make changes

### Environment Setup

Currently, the application uses MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking. No environment variables are required for development.

For production deployment with a real backend:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your API base URL:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start development server with hot module replacement
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint to check code quality

### Code Organization

- **Components** — Keep components small, focused, and reusable
- **Hooks** — Custom hooks for data fetching and business logic
- **API Layer** — All API calls through `lib/api/` for easy backend integration
- **Types** — TypeScript interfaces defined alongside their usage

### API Mocking

The application uses **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API mocking during development:

- Mock handlers are defined in `src/mocks/handlers.ts`
- Mock data is stored in `src/mocks/data/`
- MSW intercepts API requests and returns mock responses
- To disable MSW, remove the initialization in `src/main.tsx`

### Styling Guidelines

- **Mobile-First** — All styles default to mobile, then scale up
- **Tailwind Utilities** — Use Tailwind classes for styling
- **Custom Colors** — Brand colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`
- **Responsive Breakpoints** — Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:` prefixes

### Skeleton Loaders

The application uses **SkeletonLoader** components to provide smooth loading experiences similar to Facebook and YouTube. These components display animated placeholders while content is being fetched from the API.

#### Features

- **Shimmer Animation** — Smooth left-to-right shimmer effect during loading
- **Multiple Types** — Support for card, text, image, and custom skeleton types
- **Pre-built Components** — Ready-to-use `SkeletonCard`, `SkeletonProductGrid`, and `SkeletonText` components
- **Consistent Design** — Matches the app's design system with beige color palette
- **Automatic Footer Hiding** — Footer is hidden during loading to keep focus on main content

#### Usage

```tsx
import { SkeletonProductGrid, SkeletonCard } from '../../components/SkeletonLoader'

// Show skeleton grid while loading
{isLoading ? (
  <SkeletonProductGrid count={6} />
) : (
  <ProductGrid products={products} />
)}
```

The skeleton loaders automatically appear when React Query detects that data is being fetched, providing users with visual feedback that content is loading.

### Scroll-to-Top Navigation

The application automatically scrolls to the top of the page whenever users navigate to a new route. This ensures a consistent user experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

#### Behavior

- **Automatic Reset** — Scroll position resets to top (0, 0) on every route change
- **Instant Scroll** — No animation delay for immediate feedback
- **Works Everywhere** — Applies to all navigation methods:
  - Clicking navigation links (Home, Products, Orders, etc.)
  - Clicking the home logo (Dolce Fiore)
  - Programmatic navigation
  - Browser back/forward buttons

#### Implementation

The `ScrollToTop` component is integrated into `MainLayout`, ensuring it works for all routes automatically. It uses React Router's `useLocation` hook to detect route changes and scrolls the window to the top instantly.

### Navigation Bar

The application features a consistent navigation bar across all screens with the following structure:

#### Navigation Links

- **Home** — Links to the home page (`/`)
- **Products** — Links to the product catalog (`/products`)
- **About Us** — Links to the About Us page (`/about`)
- **Orders** — Links to order history (`/orders`)
- **Cart** — Shopping cart icon with item count badge (links to `/cart`)
- **Login/Signup** — Authentication links (shown when user is not logged in)
- **User Menu** — Profile dropdown menu (shown when user is logged in)

#### Navigation Features

- **Logo Link** — The "Dolce Fiore" logo on the left side of the navigation bar also links to the home page (`/`)
- **Active State** — Current page is highlighted with an underline (desktop) or left border (mobile)
- **Responsive Design** — Desktop shows all links horizontally; mobile uses a hamburger menu
- **Cart Badge** — Displays the total number of items in the cart
- **User Menu** — Dropdown menu with profile link and logout option when authenticated
